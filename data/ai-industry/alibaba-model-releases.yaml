    notes: Alibaba Cloud unveiled Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen), a large language model developed
      to compete with GPT. The Chinese name literally means "to comprehend the meaning,
      and to answer a thousand kinds of questions." Initially launched for beta testing
      in April 2023, with public release following in September 2023 after receiving
      regulatory approval. Many Qwen variants are released as open-weight models under
      the Apache-2.0 license, with models ranging from 1.8B to 235B parameters.
