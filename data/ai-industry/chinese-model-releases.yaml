    notes: Zhipu AI and Tsinghua KEG Lab released ChatGLM-6B, an open-source bilingual
      (Chinese-English) dialogue language model with 6.2 billion parameters. Based on
      the General Language Model (GLM) architecture, it was trained on approximately 1T
      tokens of Chinese and English corpus. The model supports local deployment on
      consumer-grade GPUs (6GB VRAM with INT4 quantization) and became one of the most
      popular open-source Chinese LLMs.

      and significant performance gains on benchmarks (MMLU +23%, C-Eval +33%,
      GSM8K +571%). The model supports multi-query attention and maintains the ability
      to run on consumer-grade hardware.
