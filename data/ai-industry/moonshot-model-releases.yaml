    notes: Moonshot AI (月之暗面) released Kimi Chat to the general public based on their
      "Moonshot" large language model. Moonshot AI was founded in March 2023, released
      Kimi for closed beta testing in October 2023, and opened it to the public on
      November 16, 2023. The first version supported 128,000 tokens of context
      (approximately 200,000 Chinese characters), making it the first AI model capable
      of accepting contexts of this size. Later versions expanded context to 2 million
      characters. The model is available via web app, iOS, and Android.
