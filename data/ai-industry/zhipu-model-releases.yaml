    notes: Zhipu AI and Tsinghua KEG Lab released ChatGLM-6B, an open-source bilingual
      (Chinese-English) dialogue language model with 6.2 billion parameters. Based on
      the General Language Model (GLM) architecture, it was trained on approximately 1T
      tokens of Chinese and English corpus. The model supports local deployment on
      consumer-grade GPUs (6GB VRAM with INT4 quantization) and became one of the most
      popular open-source Chinese LLMs.

    notes: Zhipu AI released ChatGLM2-6B, the second-generation version of ChatGLM-6B.
      Key improvements include 1.4T tokens of pretraining data (vs 1T), context length
      extended from 2K to 32K tokens using FlashAttention, 42% faster inference speed,
      and significant performance gains on benchmarks (MMLU +23%, C-Eval +33%,
      GSM8K +571%). The model supports multi-query attention and maintains the ability
      to run on consumer-grade hardware.

    notes: Zhipu AI announced ChatGLM3 at the Zhipu AI Dev Day. The third generation
      includes ChatGLM3-6B with stronger base model capabilities (best performance
      among sub-10B models), native support for function calling, code interpreter,
      and agent tasks. The release also included base model (ChatGLM3-6B-Base) and
      extended context variants (32K and 128K). This marked Zhipu's continued
      commitment to open-source Chinese LLMs.
